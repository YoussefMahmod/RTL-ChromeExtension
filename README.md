# RTL-ChromeExtension

Hello ..
I would like to show you the last thing I used to have fun with, and I felt that I needed it a lot, so I did it

I was faced a problem that when I write something in English and Arabic together, I find most of the words inside each other, and I don't know where to start the line and where to complete the sentence when the English word separates between two sentences

This problem is caused by the fact that the first word in the text is in English. The direction of the font is automatic, and it changes to LTR, meaning the direction of the font is left to right.

Feature 1:
Therefore, I made an extension that solves the problem that any text has anything to indicate that this text contain Arabic language automatically switches the direction to RTL (right to left)

Feature 2:
Also, if I write a comment and tag a name in English and complete it in Arabic, the same problem will occur for the same reason.
Therefore, I handled this and just write anything I want in a comment, cut the text and paste it again in the input field, it will adjust automatically

Of course, the feature above this is also available for inbox-chatting . You will find any message in any chat that has this problem fixed by automatically. and If you write a message and cut it and paste it somewhere you type the font, it will be modified automatically

### The extension works only on Facebook (for now).
